Overview:
	The Valkyrie user page should show the user all of their games, and give the
	option to create new games. The sidebar contains info about their games,
	their permissions status, how many players are in their game, etc.
	All of their games are viewable as a list of cards, and can be clicked on to
	be taken to a seperate page with extra management details for the game.
